INFORMATION FLOW:
courseArray is [] of Course(),Course() is {no,short,info,title,req,note,logi,status,size,teach}
Common to class: {short,title,teach,req,info}+index
Unique signature: {title,no,short+index,status,size,logi}+index
Retrievable from octosem view: {short}
Retrievable from unisem view: {no,short,info,}

Next step:
courseTest3.html
(A)majors-->cross-listing courses: do!
(B)courses-->nearby majors: difficult since majors flexible
Choose department-->course and generate a draggable block.
List whether a major is fulfilled based on eight rows of spaces.
Data for block: dep, short, reqs, title


Static:
bchmbs:gen,orgo,phys,bio,100a,101a,103b,104b
bioba:gen,orgo,bio,16a
-----
final:gen,orgo,phys,bio,16a

Solution:join m1 and m2, remove repeats


Elective:
bchmbs:1 100+,104a/141a
bioba:1 quant,3-5 bio elec,0-2 gen elec
-----
An elective is a set of statics and shorts.
Bioba has do more elec so solve first, overlaps or move on: ---,bchm 155b/bchm 100a/bchm 172a,bchm 101a/103b/104a/104b/100+
Bioba unresolved:quant,0 bio elec,0 gen elec
Bchmbs check against bioba statics/resolved elec/unresolved elec:bchm 155b/172a
Resolved:bchm 155b+172a,Unresolved:quant
-----
final:155b,172a,quant


Solution:check m1 elec with m2 static, check m2 elec with m1 static,compile elecs,then check for shared elecs



















New mission:
good free schedule generator-->courseTest3 parses info and displays it
include names of professors-->courseTest2 saves selected class ids locally
printable?
