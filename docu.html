BranPlan is composed of two faces. Upon loading, the first face is displayed. The spacebar will slide one out of view and the 
other into view if they are not already in the process of sliding. Here is a full documentation of the first and second faces:
<h1>First Face</h1>
The first face recalls all the tabs from the Parse cloud and loads Original. 
<h3>Console UI</h3>
After its standard two lines, the console can throw the following 8 messages:
<ul>
    <li>Tab {tab} has been stored.: upon adding</li>
    <li>A tab was not added.: upon cancelling the adding process</li>
    <li>Don't be greedy!: upon attempting to add a 7th non-Original tab</li>
    <li>Tab {tab} deleted successfully.: upon deleting</li>
    <li>Hey! You can't delete the original! I made that!: upon attempting to delete Original</li>
    <li>Tab {tab} loaded successfully.: upon loading</li>
    <li>Tab {tab} has been saved successfully.: upon saving</li>    
</ul>
<h3>Bay</h3>
Any draggable mobiles can be dragged off the bay onto the drag-and-drop UI. Mobiles cannot be dragged onto the bay,
except over the trashcan. Any course dragged onto the trashcan will disappear and cannot be retrieved without a schedule reload.
Draggable mobiles are made available by bay of the second face.
<h3>Menu of Saved Schedules</h3>
Original can be neither saved nor deleted. It has no timestamp. An attempt to save will be treated as an attempt to save it as a new tab.
The last tab is used to add a new tab. A different name will be prompted if no name is entered (Whoops! You didn't enter a name. Try again.) 
or if the name is already taken (That name is taken. Please enter another name for the new tab.).
Deleting a non-Original tab will confirm with the user that the user wishes to delete it. Upon confirmation, it cannot be retrieved without a page
reload. The previous tab will be loaded. If that tab is deleted, Original will be loaded.
The save button is intended solely for saving a schedule's state if the user wishes to load another schedule. Use the Send to Cloud button to survive
a page reload. A save rewrites the timestamp.
Clicking a tab loads that schedule unless its schedule is already open. For a schedule reload, without hitting save, load a different tab and
then load the desired schedule. All edits since the last save will have been erased.
<h3>Drag-and-Drop UI</h3>
This is the heart of the program. There are 11 semesters (4 falls, 4 springs, 3 summers). An empty row has a smaller height. There are 6 columns.
An empty column does not have a smaller width. The number of courses is calculated at the righthand side. 
Dragging any mobile lights up the save button, or a save as button in the case of Original. Classes placed in the same cell will increase the
height of the cell and count as one course. Mobiles can only be dragged off the UI if they are dragged to the trashcan in the bay.
Currently, PE and custom lab courses count as 4 credits and do not have a tooltip title.
<h1>Second Face</h1>
<h3>Course Selection</h3>
72 departments are listed in alphabetical order in the lefthand column without accessing Parse. Clicking a department accesses its courseArray on Parse and retrieves
all the courses in a second column. The courses are listed by their shorthand and full title. Clicking a course reveals more information about
the course, its sections, and an Add button for each section. If there are too many courses or sections, a scroll bar appears. The course information
is the shorthand and full title, the professor, the fulfilled graduation requirements, and the link to the course description. The section information
is the SAGE number on the button, the section's' availability and size, and the time and place of the section.

<h3>Bay</h3>
The Add button produces a block in the second face's bay and a draggable block in the first face's bay. Deletion of one block deletes the block on
the other face. Hitting the X button on a block in the bay deletes it and its draggable partner.

<h3>Changing the Season</h3>
At the very bottom, aligned with the bay, is the Switch button. It switches between Fall 2013 data and Spring 2014 data. Once the data are switched,
the next time a department is clicked, the new data will be in place.
