<h1>How do I use BranPlan?</h1>
You'll want to see the <a href="docu.html">documentation</a>.
    
<h1>Does BranPlan have a larger purpose?</h1>
Yes! I started making this over the summer of 2013 while I was still in India. It began as a planner for myself, just two plain
columns in Notepad so that I could cross-list courses for a double major. But that's not the same reason for which I've made it and its code public.
I want Brandeis to see more student initiatives over the years. Anyone can code, and all the ideas came off my desktop or through Professor Hickey's 
mentorship in using the Parse cloud. Long-term initiatives (in contrast to a part-time/full-time job) take the most effort, but they're the most rewarding
as well. Now that I feel I have grown a lot and that I am capable of producing something significant, I can get other nascent coders onto their feet.
I also hope I can save others a signifant amount of time and energy by sharing my experience.

<h1>How did you make it?</h1>
The only fancy thing is Parse, which Professor Hickey introduced to me after I'd been using localStorage. This is made in JavaScript
and is powered by jQuery. I do not recommend using Notepad unless you want a serious challenge. This uses 1 HTML file, 1 CSS file,
and 3 JavaScript files.

<h1>What can you tell me about its infrastructure?</h1>
There are three pieces to the JavaScript, for which I have three different scripts (and an estimation of how long it took compared to the entire project).

scrip.js (5%): getting the data
The same-origin policy won't allow access from one domain to the HTML at another domain. This bad-boy sets up an iframe right
on registrar-prod.unet.brandeis.edu and loads 84 departments. Scrip gathers course information in a Course object which are in
turn stored in Department objects and sent to the cloud. The challenge here is really just the nitty-gritty information scraping and
triggering the chain of events to load and upload.

core_2.js (80%): first face
The first face is the console UI, bay for added classes, menu of saved schedules, and a drag-and-drop UI. For HTML5's drag and drop,
make sure the draggable element has an id.
The largest challenges here were all related to not visualizing the final product. A good amount of code was removed or cut down on.
Then I was never sure of what the next step should be. Even a 60-second glimpse into the future would have saved me dozens of hours.
Just comprehending what users might do with files was a hassle, it being the first time. I went back and forth between a number of functions,
but the final list is: add, save, delete, load. That list alone might have saved me over a month and a great deal of head-scratching.

bay_3.js (15%): second face
This is still pretty raw as of March 4. The challenge here was organization, and I couldn't wrap my head around my own code until I started giving
longer and more appropriate names (i.e., depToCourse instead of load2). It's funny now to think that better naming choices could have saved
me a lot of stress and effort.


<h1>Who made it?</h1>    
That's me! Prakhar Sahay! I'm a proud member of the Brandeis Class of 2017. I'm equally interested in biology and computer science.
For computer science, I'm learning Java and Python. I'm most fluent in JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3/DOM/JSON/jQuery/SVG. 
BranPlan has been my JavaScript masterpiece project under Professor Timothy J. Hickey.

<h5>As it was registered:</h5>
It is a project with one end product, a JavaScript program for creating and modifying college course schedules. It utilizes Parse, jQuery, and 
JSON. The user interface collects from the Parse interface to load the user's saved schedules and courses offered by the university.

<br>Several universities already use similar programs for planning only the current semester's schedule. Other limitations include the speed when 
the school's servers are being used and the rigidity of prerequisites (which are often difficult or impossible to override). Brandeis does not 
have a similar program and my hope is to inspire students from schools which may not already offer such a program to undertake this challenge 
for their own school or to at least understand the various parts involved in my project.
